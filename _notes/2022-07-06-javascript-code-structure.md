### Summary

- Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

- In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon, but there are situations where JavaScript fails to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.

- Use `Ctrl+/` to comment out one line of code and `Ctrl+Shift+/` for multiline comments.
