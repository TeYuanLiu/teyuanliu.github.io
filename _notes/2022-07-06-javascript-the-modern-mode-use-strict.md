### Summary

- The modern mode, `use strict` adds new features to the JavaScript language and modified some of the existing ones (this may break old code).

- The special directive `"use strict"` or `'use strict'` has to be explicitly placed at the top of a script to enable this modern mode (only comments can be above it).

- When `"use strict"` is located at the top of a script, the whole strict works in a modern fashion.

- Put `"use strict"` at the beginning of a function enables strict mode in that function only.

- Advanced language structures like classes and modules enable `use strict` automatically

- Advanced language structures like classes and modules enable `"use strict"` automatically.
