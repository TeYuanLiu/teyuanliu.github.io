Here I documented some good points I found in the Google Markdown style guide.\nSyntax\nRead the Commonmark or Markdown Cheatsheet.\nCapitalization\nUse the original names of products and software, preserving the capitalization.\nTable of contents (TOC)\nPlace the TOC before the first H2 heading.\nDocument layout\nHere is a good example of the document layout.\n\nCharacter line limit\nMarkdown content follows the residual convention of an 80-character line limit.\nExceptions\nExceptions to the 80-character rule include:\n\nLinks\nTables\nHeadings\nCode blocks\n\nHeadings\nUse unique, complete names for headings\nUse unique and fully descriptive names for each heading, even for sub-sections, as anchor links are automatically-constructed from them.\nPrefer:\n\nover:\n\nUse a single H1 heading\nUse one H1 heading as the title of the document.\nLists\nUse lazy numbering for long list and explicit otherwise\nFor long lists that may change, lazy numbering is quite useful.\nNested list spacing\nWhen nesting lists, use a 4-space indent for both numbered and bulleted lists. When lists are not nested and small, one space can suffice for both cases.\nCode\nInline\nUse inline code when referring to short code quotations, field names, or file types.\nCode blocks\nFor code quotations longer than a single line, use a fenced code block for language syntax highlighting support, less ambiguity, and better search result.\n\nEscape newlines\nEscape any newline with a backslash for shell commands as they are most likely will be copied and pasted into a terminal.\n\nNest code blocks within lists\nIndent the code block within a list to preserve the list structure.\nLinks\nShorten the links as long links are difficult to read and break the 80 character wrapping.\nAvoid relative paths unless within the same directory\nAvoid relatives paths that requires a ../ inside the link.\nUse informative Markdown link titles\nGive links meaningful titles and avoid using \"here\", \"link\", or duplicating the target URL as doing so gives basically zero information.\nReference\nUse reference links for long links or duplication reduction\nUse reference links when the length of the link would detract from the readability of the surrounding text if it were inlined, or when the link is used multiple times.\nDefine reference links after their first use\nPut reference link definitions just before the next heading, at the end of the section in which they're first used. This practice prevents \"footnote overload\" at the bottom of the file, which makes it difficult to pick out the relevant link destination. However, reference links that are used in multiple sections should go at the end of the document to prevent potential dangling links.\nImages\nUse images only if it's easier to show a reader something than to describe it such as a flowchart of UI.\nTables\nUse tables when the data distribution is relatively uniform across two dimensions and there are many parallel items with distinct attributes. Otherwise, subheadings and lists are often suffice to present the same information.\nSee also\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/markdown/","title":"Markdown"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/vscode/":{"body":"Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can become super powerful with extension and plugin installed.\nTerminal commands\n\n\nOpen a directory.\n\ncode &lt;DIRECTORY&gt;\n\n\n\nVSCode commands\n\n\nMove cursor by word.\n\nCtrl + Left / Right\nsdf\n\n\n\nHighlight words matching the current word.\n\nCtrl + D\nPress D multiple times to highlight multiple occurrences.\n\n\n\nSet cursors.\n\nAlt + Left click\nClick multiple times to set multiple cursors.\n\n\n\nCut line.\n\nCtrl + X\n\n\n\nMove line.\n\nAlt + Up / Down\n\n\n\nHighlight lines.\n\nAlt + Shift + Up / Down\n\n\n\nHighlight line.\n\nCtrl + L\n\n\n\nToggle comment.\n\nHighlight lines and then Ctrl + /\n\n\n\nOpen terminal.\n\nCtrl + `\n\n\n\nClear terminal (not working).\n\nCtrl + K\n\n\n\nCommand palette\n\n\nOpen command palette.\n\nCtrl + P\n\n\n\nSearch files.\n\nType file names on command palette.\n\n\n\nSearch supported commands.\n\nType &gt; on command palette.\nOr Ctrl + Shift + P\nSearch for toggle minimap or other commands.\n\n\n\nSearch symbol.\n\nType @ on command palette.\nCtrl + Shift + .\n\n\n\nSearch global symbol.\n\nType # on command palette.\n\n\n\nGo to line.\n\nType : on command palette.\nOr Ctrl + G\n\n\n\nManage tasks.\n\nType &gt;task on command palette.\n\n\n\nManage snippets.\n\nType &gt;snippet on command palette.\n\n\n\nRename variable or function (not working).\n\nShift + Alt + F12\nRename every reference at once.\n\n\n\nGit integration\n\nDeeply nested file\n\nUse \\ between directories and file to create a deeply nested file.\n\n\n\nFrequently-used extensions\n\nQuokka: Execute and show the output of JavaScript inline code.\nAuto rename tag: Auto rename paired HTML tag.\nAdd jsdoc comments: Add jsdoc @param and @return tags for selected functions.\nBetter comments: Improve code commenting by annotating with alert.\nGitLens: Supercharge the Git capabilities.\nRemote repositories: Remotely browse and edit a GitHub repository.\nRemote SSH: Open any folder on a remote machine using SSH.\nRemote containers: Open any folder inside a Docker container.\nFlutter snippet: Use snippets to reduce repetitive work.\nPaste JSON as code: Copy JSON and paste as TypeScript, Go, C++, and more.\n\nSee also\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/vscode/","title":"Visual Studio Code"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/zola/":{"body":"Zola is a static site generator (SSG) written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine.
