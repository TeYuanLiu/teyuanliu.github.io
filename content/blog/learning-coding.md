    -   Learn and retain problem solving patterns over programming language syntax.
1.   Go and build something.
    -   Code with the mindset of prioritizing correctness, and then readability, and then performance.
    -   Code with AI.
        -   Start new AI chat for each distinct task to keep context focused and minimal.
        -   Let AI generate a basic implementation.
        -   Question architectural decisions and refactor the generated code into smaller, focused modules.
        -   Strengthen type definitions and interfaces.
        -   Document architectural decision and module boundary.
            -   Use AI-generated description as supplement but not replacement of handwritten ones.
            -   Add comments to clarify the reason why this piece of code exists.
        -   Add edge case and error handling.
    -   Dependency management
    -   Modular design
    -   Feature flag
    -   Code data separation
        -   Database schema compatibility
    -   Gradual depreciation (mark feature as deprecated in earlier versions before removal)
