## JavaScript in browser

JavaScript in browser is configured to be safe to the users. Therefore, it cannot:
    -   Access kernel functions.
    -   Know the existence of other browser tabs unless one tab uses JavaScript to open another one.
    -   Request data from a server with different origin unless configured.

JSON is the native data format for JavaScript.

We use camelCase for JSON field names because of its consistency with JavaScript variable names.
