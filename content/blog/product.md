We have a business idea, and that's super cool! Now let's think about how to turn it into a product. Here are some steps that may give us some guidance.

## Steps

1.  Inception
    -  What kind of product do we want to sell?
    -  What feature does the product offer?
    -  Does the product generate revenue via subscription or one-time sale?
1.  Market survey
    -   Does the product have a unique feature that is different from the current major players in the market?
    -   Is the market growing with new customers coming in?
1.  Minimum-Viable-Product (MVP)
    -   Prioritize the features based on impact to engineer hour cost ratio and get a list of functional/non-functional requirements, achieving high Return-On-investment (ROI).
    -   Synchronize with customers on the tradeoff between time and feature quality/quantity, and delivery deadlines.
    -   [Design](@/blog/system-design.md) and [implement](@/blog/development-cycle.md) a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) system.
1.  Iteration
    -   Collect feedback about the MVP from customers to quickly iterate and improve.
    -   Give customers 7-day free trial, plus monthly and yearly plan.
    -   Ask for the reason of unsubscribing to learn which direction to move forward and improve retention rate.
    -   Conduct gradual deprecation by marking a feature as deprecated in earlier versions before its actual removal.
