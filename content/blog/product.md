I have a great idea, but how to turn it into a successful software product? Here are some steps that may give us some guidance.

## Steps

1.  Inception
    -  What kind of product do we want to sell? What features does it offer?
    -  Do we want to build a product that generates revenue via subscription and maintenance, or the one for one-time sale?
1.  Market survey
    -   Does our product have unique features that are different from the current major players in the market?
    -   Is the market growing with new customers coming in?
1.  Minimum-Viable-Product (MVP)
    -  Turn customersâ€™ feature requests into MVP tech spec.
    -  Evaluate each feature's impact to engineering hour cost ratio to prioritize high Return-On-investment (ROI) features.
    -   Synchronize with customers on the tradeoff between time and feature quantity/quality, and delivery deadlines.
    -   Implement a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) system using hybrid development style and monolithic architecture.
    -   Set up an operational dashboard for logs, metrics, and alerts.
    -   Work with the design team to polish the user interface.
    -   Write documentation.
1.  Iteration
    -   Collect feedback about the MVP from customers to quickly iterate and improve.
    -   Give customers 7-day free trial, plus monthly and yearly plan.
    -   Ask for the reason of unsubscribing to learn which direction to move forward and improve retention rate.
